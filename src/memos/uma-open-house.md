> I grew up in a house called Can Obert. Can Obert means open house and my parents really lived by that philosophy always. So I grew up in a world where people were constantly coming and going and creating. And I feel very luck for that. 
> 
> I think that the way I grew up has really informed my work and the way I see things.
> 
> I've always thought that creativity has to be generous. It has to be inclusive and aware in a way of the world around us and I think that that's really what I'm trying to do and what I want to do.
> 
> I want to create a space where they can all be heard. All of them. All of these people who have been a part of my life. And that's what this project is about. That's what my songs are about. All of the people I've loved because in the end it's all about love.
